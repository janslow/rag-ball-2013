	    Buy your ticket in the knowledge that your evening will be helping others at Oxford&#39;s university wide charity ball.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    This year the ball will be supporting RAG&#39;s elected charities with all our profits going to:<br />
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    <strong><a href="http://www.againstmalaria.com/">The Against Malaria Foundation</a></strong><br />
	    <img src="http://www.oxfordragball.co.uk/images/AM_logo_sm.jpg" alt="The Against Malaria Foundation" style="float:left; padding: 5px;" />
	    The Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) aims to limit the spread of malaria, which kills between 1 and 3 million people each year 
	    and is the single largest killer of children, by distributing long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets in areas where they are 
	    otherwise unavailable. 100% of the money given to the organisation will go towards purchasing mosquito nets at &dollar;5 a go; thanks to 
	    this incredible efficiency, the AMF has already provided over 2 and a half million nets. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    <strong><a href="http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/crisis-skylight-oxford.html">Crisis Skylight Oxford</a></strong><br />
	    <img src="http://www.oxfordragball.co.uk/images/crisis_logo.gif" alt="Crisis Skylight" style="float:left; padding: 5px;" />
	    Crisis Skylight Oxford is focussed on tackling the very visible issue of homelessness in Oxford. They provide a range of classes 
	    and vocational training to give those affected by homelessness a chance to re-integrate with society, in addition to a dedicated 
	    employment service to make sure that these people have the opportunity to get back on their feet. 
	  </p>

	    <strong><a href="http://www.helenanddouglas.org.uk/">Helen and Douglas House</a></strong><br />
	    <img src="http://www.oxfordragball.co.uk/images/h_d_h_logo.gif" alt="Helen and Douglas House" style="float:left; padding: 5px;" />
	    Helen and Douglas House as an organisation represents two separate hospices. Helen House was the world’s first children&#39;s 
	    hospice and continues to provide care for children under the age of 16 with life-shortening conditions. Douglas House provides 
	    the same palliative care, but to young adults between the ages of 16 and 35. The charity has won The Queen’s Award for Voluntary 
	    Service:  the MBE for volunteer groups.   
	  </p>
	 
	  <p>
	    <strong><a href="http://www.jacari.org/">Jacari</a></strong><br />
	    <img src="http://www.oxfordragball.co.uk/images/jacari.jpg" alt="Jacari" style="float:left; padding: 5px;" />
	    Jacari is a student-run charity which links Oxford students (both University and Brookes) with local ethnic minority 
	    children who need help with reading, writing and speaking English, in addition to providing tuition in other subjects 
	    on request. The help given to these children boosts their confidence and broadens their horizons; Jacari allows university 
	    students to have a real, positive impact on the surrounding community.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    We are the only ball in Oxford gives all its profits to charity, last year raising &pound;10,500, which the committee 
	    are working tirelessly to beat.
