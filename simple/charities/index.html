Last year, Oxford students raised over &pound;11,000 through RAG Ball, a total this year's committee is working tirelessly to beat.</p><p>At the core of RAG Ball is our commitment to fundraising for Oxford RAG's four student chosen charities, and promoting engagement between Oxford RAG and students. RAG Ball 2013 is also working with OUSU's Environment and Ethics campaign to become the first Sustain-a-Ball, and limit our environmental impact and supporting local business.</p><p>By buying your ticket, not only are you guaranteed an incredible evening, you're also donating to four very different, very important charities:</p><h3>Education Partnership Africa</h3><a href="http://www.epafrica.org/" class="charity-image" data-link="charity-epa"><span class="charities-epa">&nbsp;</span></a><p>Education Partnerships Africa is a UK Charity and East African NGO working hard to improve the standard of education open to young people in Kenya and Uganda. Students from Oxford, Cambridge, London and Manchester Universities take the opportunity to go and work within rural secondary schools every year, helping to equip and develop disadvantaged schools.</p><p>Over the past five years, EPAfrica has impacted the lives of over 10,000 Kenyan students, spent &pound;9,000 on textbooks, &pound;12,000 on school buildings and &pound;5,000 on science equipment with the aim of increasing grades and raising aspirations in rural secondary schools. The money raised by RAG Ball will help to continue this work, and make a real difference to Kenyan and Ugandan students.</p><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><h3>Students Supporting Street Kids</h3><a href="http://www.sssk.org.uk/" class="charity-image" data-link="charity-sssk"><span class="charities-sssk">&nbsp;</span></a><p>SSSK estimates that there are approximately 100 million street children around the world, vulnerable to all kinds of physical danger and exploitation by employers. Many end up on the streets because of family breakdown, acute poverty or local conflict, surviving often by begging or rag-picking, and worst cases turning to prostitution and crime.</p><p>SSSK is a small, student-run charity, emphasising the potential of street children, rather than presenting them as victims. SSSK supports NGO's in Egypt, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Kosovo, and Columbia amongst others. Each NGO has a strong relationship with the SSSK, ensuring that every penny of money raised is spent with the aim of improving the lives of street kids. The work of SSSK's chosen NGO's encourages advocacy for street kids, and projects that provide stability and shelter.</p><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><h3>The Oxford Food Bank</h3><a href="http://www.oxfordfoodbank.co.uk/" class="charity-image" data-link="charity-ofb"><span class="charities-ofb">&nbsp;</span></a><p>The Oxford Food Bank works with local food suppliers to collect good quality fresh food, which is then donated to local registered charities for free! For every &pound;1 donated to the Oxford Food Bank, &pound;25 worth of food is delivered – an amazing result for those Oxford community projects that depend upon the food bank.</p><p>The Oxford Food Bank works with the homeless, the elderly, those with mental health problems, children, families on low incomes and other vulnerable members of our Oxford's community.</p><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><h3>Giving What We Can</h3><a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/" class="charity-image" data-link="charity-gwwc"><span class="charities-gwwc">&nbsp;</span></a><p>Extreme poverty is one of the most important issues of our age. Of the 6.6 billion people in the world, every day 2.5 billion live on less than &dollar;2.5 a day, whilst more than 1 billion lack access to clean drinking water. Whilst the causes and scale of poverty is immense, Giving What We Can emphasises that the problem is solvable, and by giving a small amount to effective charities, each of us can still transform the lives of hundreds of people.</p><p>Giving What We Can works in two ways; firstly it innovatively identifies the most efficient and effective charities tackling extreme poverty. Secondly, it encourages its members to donate 10% of their income to charity, which so far has led to a pledge total of &dollar;138 million – which although impressive is still a fraction of what's needed to end extreme poverty.</p><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div></div></div><ul id="footer"><li class="window"><a href="/window" data-link="footer-full">Full Site</a></li><li class="accessibility"><a href="/simple/accessibility" data-link="footer-accessibility">Accessibility</a></li><li class="mobile"><a href="/mobile/home" data-link="footer-mobile">Mobile</a></li><li class="cookies"><a href="/simple/cookies" data-link="footer-cookies">Cookies</a></li><li class="contact"><a href="/simple/committee" data-link="footer-committee">Contact</a></li><li class="copyright"><a data-link="copyright">Copyright Jay Anslow 2013</a></li></ul><script>var links = document.querySelectorAll("a");
