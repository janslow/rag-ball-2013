<p>On <strong>November 23rd</strong>, let time stand still as you leave Oxford behind, and come away with to Neverland with RAG Ball 2013. Enter a world where imagination takes over and adventure is around every corner. Feel the everyday melt away as you escape into a land somewhere between dream and reality.</p>
<p>Leave behind the streets of Kensington, and find yourself exploring the delights of Neverwood and relaxing in the music of the acoustic Enchanted Cave. Quench your thirst in the Mermaid Lagoon, and be pampered like never before in the Pixie Hollow. Whether you choose to dance the night away under the Neverland Sky, walk on water in Mermaid Bay, or risk everything on red aboard the Jolly Roger, Neverland has something for everyone.</p>

<p>Lose yourself in this fantasy, where youth is eternal, and mystery is everywhere. Neverland is waiting for you.</p>
