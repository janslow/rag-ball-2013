  <p>Upon arrival in Kensington you are greeted with a Treasure Map depicting an unknown land full of marvel, magic and mystery...</p>

    <span class='line'>That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland.<span class='close'>&rdquo;</span></span>
  </div>
 
  <p>The first glimpse of Neverland is the luscious Neverwood. Venturing through the foliage, you encounter forest folk - a <strong>henna artist</strong> and <strong>face painter</strong>. You continue on your way in search of the lost treasure...</p>
   
  <p>Wander down into The Enchanted Cave and you will be immediately captivated by an eclectic array of <strong>acoustic acts</strong> including the phenomenally talented Jake Morley.</p>

  <p>Leaving the music behind, you spy spiralling smoke in the distance. Relax with a <strong>Shisha pipe</strong> or take a trip to the Lost Boy's Hideout and go wild on the <strong>Bungee Run</strong>, <strong>Gladiator Joust</strong> and much more.</p>

  <p>Underneath the Neverland sky, our headliners, <strong>Kids In Glass Houses</strong>, promise an unforgettable set to get you dancing in the land where time stands still. And don't forget <strong>Mutant Vinyl</strong>, our supporting act. <!--You can check out a sample of their music <a href='/downloads/mutant_vinyl_acid_honey.mp3' target='_blank' data-link='entz-acidhoney'>here</a>.--></p>

  <p>Your quest for treasure leads you upstairs, to Pixie Hollow where you take a well-deserved break and, after <strong>pampering</strong>, <strong>massages</strong> and <strong>hairdressing</strong>, you to return to your quest.</p>

  <p>Whilst sounds of cosmic Funk, soul and latin styles float over the hills, illusions of a <strong>magician</strong> mask the way ahead and leave you stumbling onto the bow of a ship...</p>
   
  <p>Finally, on the top deck aboard the Jolly Roger you find what you have been looking for. In between the <strong>poker tables</strong> and <strong>roulette wheels</strong>, lying untouched is the treasure!</p>

  <p>Feeling elated, you find the silent disco and end your journey with a <strong>survivors photo</strong> with the friends that have stayed with you every step of the way!</p>

  <p>With still more surprises that are yet to be revealed in Neverland... what will you discover there?</p>
