<p>The RAG Ball presents an unparalleled opportunity to build awareness for your company within the diverse population of the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>With attendance of over 1200 students, and marketing access to over 20,000 members of the University, sponsorship of the RAG Ball formulates access to far more students than any individual society. In addition, sponsorship of the RAG Ball will give your company immediate access to first year students amongst whom there is a strong tradition of attendance.</p>

<p>The RAG Ball has a huge presence on campus and online and we are working on providing innovative methods to help maximise advertising for your company should you choose to support us. The event will be launched later this month, from which point your brand can feature across all our promotional material. For large companies or corporations, we are able to arrange events for your company to engage with current Oxford students on a one-to-one basis which would be beneficial for graduate recruitment schemes. These are highlighted in our Sponsorship Proposal and include intimate networking events for around 40 undergraduates or larger ones of up to 300 undergraduates.</p>

<p>Supporting the RAG Ball will also aid your corporate social responsibility as the Ball aims to raise over £10,000 to donate to our four student-nominated <a href='/{{ page.layout }}/charities'>charities</a>.</p>

<p>If this is an opportunity that interests you, we’d love for you to get in contact either by emailing <a href='mailto:sponsorship.ragball@ousu.org'>sponsorship.ragball@ousu.org</a> or by calling Jodie on 07738545400 or Rachel on 07999499514. We would be happy to send you our full Sponsorship Proposal and tailor a package that works for you.</p>
