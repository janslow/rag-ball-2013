<h3>First Party Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie (called &ldquo;Cookie&rdquo;) is stored to remember which version of the site you use (<a href='?version=window'>Full</a>, <a href='?version=simple'>Simple</a> or <a href='?version=mobile'>Mobile</a>). It is stored for 7 days.</p>
<p>If you disable cookies (or clear them), the site should work fine, except you won't be able to change version (e.g., mobile users can't view the full or simple site).</p>

<h3>Third Party Cookies and Tracking</h3>
<p>This site also uses Google Analytics to track how you and other users interact with the site. This is done by storing various cookies in your browser. The information is then anonymised and then displayed in useful charts and tables to webmasters.</p>

<p>This information is vital to making this website (and others around Oxford) even better for you and people like you. For example, I could tell from another Oxford site's analytics that 11% of visits came from mobile devices, so I created a <a href='/mobile/cookies?version=mobile' data-link='content-mobile'>mobile site</a> for this one.</p>

<p>For more information, you can read the <a href='http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/analytics/privacyoverview.html'>Google Analytics Privacy Policy</a>.
