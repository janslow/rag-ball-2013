Last year, Oxford students <strong>raised over &pound;11,000 through RAG Ball</strong>, a total this year's committee is working tirelessly to beat.</p><p>At the core of RAG Ball is our commitment to fundraising for Oxford RAG's <strong>four student chosen charities</strong>, and promoting engagement between Oxford RAG and students. RAG Ball 2013 is also working with OUSU's Environment and Ethics campaign to become the <strong>first Sustain-a-Ball</strong>, and <strong>limit our environmental impact</strong> and <strong>supporting local business</strong>.</p><p>By buying your ticket, not only are you guaranteed an incredible evening, you're also <strong>donating to four very different, very important charities</strong>:</p><h3>Education Partnership Africa</h3><a href="http://www.epafrica.org/" target="_blank" class="charity-image" data-link="charity-epa"><span class="charities-epa">&nbsp;</span></a><p>Education Partnerships Africa is a UK Charity and East African NGO working hard to <strong>improve the standard of education</strong> open to young people <strong>in Kenya and Uganda</strong>. Students from Oxford, Cambridge, London and Manchester Universities take the opportunity to go and work within rural secondary schools every year, helping to <strong>equip and develop disadvantaged schools</strong>.</p><p>Over the past five years, EPAfrica has impacted the lives of <strong>over 10,000 Kenyan students</strong>, spent <strong>&pound;9,000 on textbooks</strong>, <strong>&pound;12,000 on school buildings</strong> and <strong>&pound;5,000 on science equipment</strong> with the aim of increasing grades and <strong>raising aspirations</strong> in rural secondary schools. The money raised by RAG Ball will help to continue this work, and make a real difference to Kenyan and Ugandan students.</p><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><h3>Students Supporting Street Kids</h3><a href="http://www.sssk.org.uk/" target="_blank" class="charity-image" data-link="charity-sssk"><span class="charities-sssk">&nbsp;</span></a><p>SSSK estimates that there are approximately <strong>100 million street children</strong> around the world, vulnerable to all kinds of physical danger and exploitation by employers. Many end up on the streets because of family breakdown, acute poverty or local conflict, <strong>surviving often by begging or rag-picking</strong>, and worst cases turning to <strong>prostitution and crime</strong>.</p><p>SSSK is a small, <strong>student-run charity</strong>, emphasising the potential of street children, rather than presenting them as victims. SSSK supports NGO's in <strong>Egypt, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Kosovo, and Columbia</strong> amongst others. Each NGO has a strong relationship with the SSSK, ensuring that every penny of money raised is spent with the aim of improving the lives of street kids. The work of SSSK's chosen NGO's <strong>encourages advocacy</strong> for street kids, and projects that <strong>provide stability and shelter</strong>.</p><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><h3>The Oxford Food Bank</h3><a href="http://www.oxfordfoodbank.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="charity-image" data-link="charity-ofb"><span class="charities-ofb">&nbsp;</span></a><p>The Oxford Food Bank works with <strong>local food suppliers</strong> to collect good quality fresh food, which is then <strong>donated to local registered charities</strong> for free! For every &pound;1 donated to the Oxford Food Bank, &pound;25 worth of food is delivered – an amazing result for those Oxford community projects that depend upon the food bank.</p><p>The Oxford Food Bank works with <strong>the homeless</strong>, <strong>the elderly</strong>, those with <strong>mental health problems</strong>, <strong>children</strong>, families on <strong>low incomes</strong> and other <strong>vulnerable members</strong> of our Oxford's community.</p><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div><h3>Giving What We Can</h3><a href="http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/" target="_blank" class="charity-image" data-link="charity-gwwc"><span class="charities-gwwc">&nbsp;</span></a><p>Extreme poverty is one of the most important issues of our age. Of the 6.6 billion people in the world, every day <strong>2.5 billion live on less than &dollar;2.50 a day</strong>, whilst more than <strong>1 billion lack access to clean drinking water</strong>. Whilst the causes and scale of poverty is immense, Giving What We Can emphasises that the problem is solvable, and by giving a small amount to effective charities, each of us can still <strong>transform the lives of hundreds of people</strong>.</p><p>Giving What We Can works in two ways; firstly it innovatively identifies the <strong>most efficient and effective charities</strong> tackling extreme poverty. Secondly, it encourages its members to <strong>donate 10% of their income</strong> to charity, which so far has led to a pledge <strong>total of &dollar;138 million</strong> – which although impressive is still a fraction of what's needed to end extreme poverty.</p><div class="clear">&nbsp;</div></div></div></div><div id="popups"><iframe src="/window-iframe/committee/" class="committee"></iframe><iframe src="/window-iframe/sponsors/" class="sponsors"></iframe><iframe src="/window-iframe/cookies/" class="cookies"></iframe></div><div id="popup-blur">&nbsp;</div><ul id="social"><li><a title="/oxfordragball" target="_blank" class="social-fb" href="https://www.facebook.com/oxfordragball" data-link="social-fb">&nbsp;</a></li><li><a title="@oxfordragball" target="_blank" class="social-twitter" href="https://twitter.com/oxfordragball" data-link="social-twitter">&nbsp;</a></li></ul><ul id="footer"><li class="simple"><a href="/simple/home?version=simple" data-link="footer-simple">Not Displaying Correctly?</a></li><li class="mobile"><a href="/mobile/home?version=mobile" data-link="footer-mobile">Mobile</a></li><li class="cookies"><a href="#" class="popup" data-link="cookies" data-popup="cookies">Cookies</a></li><li class="contact"><a href="#" class="popup" data-link="committee" data-popup="committee">Contact</a></li><li class="copyright"><a data-link="copyright">Copyright Jay Anslow 2013</a></li></ul><script>var links = document.querySelectorAll("a");
